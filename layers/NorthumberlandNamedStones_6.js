However, the King's sons set out after Comyn and killed him at this site. This is clearly a made-up story, and the cross was more likely to have been placed here to mark a land boundary in the 12th-15th centuries."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.3152484,55.05672]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"fid":"96","Name":"Carlin Stone","description":"On flank of Carlin Hill N of Newtonrigg Farm.
